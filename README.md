# Fraction Feast: Food Truck Challenge\! üööüçïüçü

Welcome to "Fraction Feast," a fun and interactive web-based game designed to make learning fractions delicious\! Step into the shoes of a busy food truck owner and serve up mathematically accurate portions to your hungry customers.

-----

## üéÆ Game Concept

In "Fraction Feast," players take on the challenge of running a bustling food truck. Customers will place orders for specific fractional portions of various dishes (e.g., "I'd like half a pizza and a quarter of the fries\!"). Your goal is to visually and numerically divide ingredients and assemble servings correctly to satisfy their cravings.

This game focuses on:

  * **Fractions:** Identifying, comparing, adding, subtracting, and finding equivalent fractions.
  * **Division:** Dividing ingredients into equal parts.
  * **Multiplication:** Basic scaling of recipes (for later, more complex levels).

It ties into everyday life by simulating cooking, sharing food, understanding recipes, and practicing portion control, all while reinforcing essential math skills\!

## ‚ú® Features (Planned & Current)

  * **Random Customer Orders:** Get unique fractional orders for various food items. (Implemented in `script.js`)
  * **Interactive Ingredient Station:** Visually divide ingredients into correct fractional parts. (Basic placeholder in `index.html` and `script.js`)
  * **Serving Area:** Assemble and combine different portions to fulfill orders. (Basic placeholder in `index.html` and `script.js`)
  * **Order Validation:** Check if your serving matches the customer's order accurately. (Basic direct comparison in `script.js` - **needs full fraction equivalence logic**)
  * **Feedback System:** Receive instant feedback on your performance.
  * **Engaging Theme:** A fun food truck setting to make learning enjoyable.

      * Allow players to add and subtract fractional portions in their serving area.
      * Support improper fractions and mixed numbers.
  * **Visual Ingredient Manipulation:**
      * Interactive SVG or Canvas elements to show pizzas, cakes, etc., visually divided.
      * Drag-and-drop functionality for moving cut portions.
  * **Multiple Ingredients:** Add more food types like burgers, salads, and more complex dishes requiring multiple ingredients.
  * **Level Progression:** Introduce increasing difficulty, new ingredients, and more complex fraction challenges.
  * **Scoring System:** Track player performance, time limits, and accuracy.
  * **Sound Effects & Music:** Enhance the game experience with audio.
  * **Mobile Responsiveness:** Further optimize for play on various devices.
  * **Recipe Scaling:** Introduce challenges where players need to scale recipes up or down using multiplication.
